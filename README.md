# biomaRt_tutorial
A tutorial on using the biomaRt R package to retrieve sweet data.

Simply follow along in biomaRt_demo.R and you will learn how to use the `biomaRt` package.

The GTF_converter.R script is an example of how to use `biomaRt` to do real work (converting gene ids in this case). The demo .gtf was created using the getGTF.sh shell script.
